# **SubReconX** üöÄ

## **Overview**
SubReconX is an automated subdomain enumeration tool that combines **CEWL**, **host lookups**, and **DNSRecon** to efficiently discover active subdomains. It extracts words from the target website, generates subdomains, resolves them, and performs a CRT certificate search for additional findings. The final results are cleaned and deduplicated for better usability.

## **Features**
‚úÖ **CEWL Word Extraction** ‚Äì Extracts words from the target website to generate potential subdomains.  
‚úÖ **Parallel Subdomain Resolution** ‚Äì Uses `host` for efficient resolution with controlled concurrency.  
‚úÖ **DNSRecon CRT Search** ‚Äì Finds subdomains from SSL certificates.  
‚úÖ **Automatic Deduplication** ‚Äì Ensures a clean, unique list of subdomains.  
‚úÖ **Error Handling** ‚Äì Handles failures gracefully for a smooth user experience.  

## **Installation**
Ensure the required dependencies are installed:
```bash
sudo apt install cewl dnsrecon dnsutils -y
```

## **Usage**
Make the script executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x subreconx.sh
./subreconx.sh
```
You will be prompted to enter:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Target Domain** (e.g., `example.com`)  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **URL for CEWL Extraction** (defaults to `https://example.com`)  

The script will:
- Extract words from the website using CEWL.
- Generate and resolve subdomains using `host`.
- Perform a CRT certificate search with DNSRecon.
- Merge, clean, and deduplicate results.

## **Output Files**
- `example.com_words.txt` ‚Üí Extracted words from CEWL  
- `example.com_hosts.txt` ‚Üí Active subdomains from host lookups  
- `example.com_final_results.txt` ‚Üí Final deduplicated subdomains  

## **Example Output**
